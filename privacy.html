        <h1>Privacy Policy for ShieldX</h1>

        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 16, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>SuMo Productivity Experts ("we," "us," or "our") operates the ShieldX mobile application (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains our commitment to your privacy, detailing how information is handled within the Service.</p>
        <p><strong>Our Privacy Commitment:</strong> While ShieldX is designed to perform its core blocking functionality on your device, it utilizes third-party services for analytics, advertising, and remote configuration. We are committed to transparency about the data processed by these services. All your personal blocking configurations and rules are stored exclusively on your device and are not transmitted to our servers.</p>

        <h2>2. Information and Data Handling</h2>
        
        <h3>Data Processed Locally on Your Device</h3>
        <p>All core blocking functionalities of the Service process data directly on your device. This data is not accessible to us. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blocking Rules and Profiles:</strong> All rules, profiles, schedules, and block lists you create are stored only on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Installed Apps Information:</strong> The Service accesses the list of your installed applications solely to allow you to select apps for your blocking rules. This list is not transmitted off your device.</li>
            <li><strong>AccessibilityService API & NotificationListenerService Data:</strong> To perform its blocking functions, ShieldX uses these services to detect URLs, in-app features, or notifications you have chosen to block. All sensitive data from these services is processed on your device in real-time and is not logged, stored, or transmitted by us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information We May Collect and Transmit</h3>
        <p>To maintain and improve the Service, certain non-personal and operational data is transmitted to third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anonymous Analytics and Crash Reports:</strong> We use <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> to collect anonymous diagnostic data in the event of an app crash or error. This data includes device type, OS version, and app state, and it helps us fix technical problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Wrongful Block Reports:</strong> If you choose to report content that was blocked incorrectly, we transmit the blocked content's identifier (e.g., URL or keyword) and the reason for the block to our analytics services to improve our blocking accuracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Remote Logging:</strong> To diagnose service reliability issues, the app sends anonymized operational logs to <strong>Google Cloud Firestore</strong>. These logs include a randomly generated anonymous user ID, session ID, and device information, but do not include your Browse history or personal content.</li>
            <li><strong>Remote Configuration:</strong> The app periodically contacts <strong>Firebase Remote Config</strong> to fetch settings, such as information about app updates.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Identifiers:</strong> To support our Service, we display ads using <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. These services may collect anonymous identifiers (like Google's Advertising ID) to serve personalized or non-personalized ads and to manage your consent choices via Google's User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Use of Data</h2>
        <p>Any data collected is used for the following limited purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide the Service:</strong> To enable the core, local-only blocking functionality of the app.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve and Monitor the Service:</strong> To detect, prevent, and address technical issues using anonymous crash reports and operational logs.</li>
            <li><strong>To Support the Service:</strong> To provide you with advertising.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Advertising</h2>
        <p>We use Google AdMob to show advertisements, which helps keep the Service free. For users in regions like the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK, we use Google's User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK to manage your consent for personalized advertising. You can change your preferences at any time in the app's settings.</p>
        <p>For more information, please see <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">Google's partner sites policy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>5. Service Providers</h2>
        <p>We use third-party companies for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Cloud Firestore:</strong> For remote logging and configuration.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> To provide anonymous crash and error reporting.</li>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> To serve advertisements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These third parties are bound by their own privacy policies and are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Since all personal data is stored locally on your device, we do not retain any personal information on our servers. Anonymous crash reports, logs, and advertising data are retained according to our third-party providers' policies.</p>

        <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>The limited anonymous data we collect may be processed by our third-party providers in countries outside your residence. These providers maintain appropriate safeguards for international data transfers.</p>

        <h2>8. Your Data Rights and Control</h2>
        <p>Since all your personal data (such as blocking rules) is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it. You can delete all your data at any time by clearing the application's data from your device's settings or by uninstalling the application.</p>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is not directed to anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has used our app and you have concerns, please contact us.</p>
        
        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
